            <p>The Lounge Chair, which was designed by Charles and Ray Eames in the 1950s, is now regarded as one of the most important furniture designs of the twentieth century. For decades Vitra has employed virtually the same manufacturing methods and high-quality materials in the production of this chair. If the Lounge Chair and Ottomon are ordered together, care is given during the production process to ensure that the wooden shells of both pieces are perfectly matched.</p>
